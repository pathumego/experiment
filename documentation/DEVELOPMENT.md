#Development Notes


##04th October 2015

So I'm experimenting and researching few different aspects at the moment.
- Responsive Fonts:
        - Size specific adjustments in type desgin :)
        - Current practices in responsive web typography.
        - Optical adjustments to type concerning the horizontal space a font occupy. (Condensed/wide)
        - Research covering reading on screens, optimum number of charachters per line and thinking how those research relate to no latin scripts.
